### Hi there dear stranger

  Glad you're reading this. My name is Josué, I'm 15 and currently studying Software Engineering and Web development [here](https://etecfernandopolis.com.br/site/inicio/). I got interest in competitive programming a while ago, and since then I spent most of my time listening to Lo-Fi, studying about Data Structures and algorithms (You can find part of my work [here](https://github.com/J0sueTM/Competitive-Programming)). And I'm a linux enthusiast I use Arch [BTW]

Hope my repositories help you somehow :)
