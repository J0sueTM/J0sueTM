### Hi there dear stranger

  Glad you're reading this. My name is Josué, I'm 15 and currently studying Software Engineering and Web development [here](https://etecfernandopolis.com.br/site/inicio/). I got interested in programming a while ago, since then I spent most of my time listening to Lo-Fi, freaking out on Codeforces and studying about Data Structures and algorithms (You can find part of my work [here](https://github.com/J0sueTM/Competitive-Programming)). I'm also a linux enthusiast.

Hope my repositories help you somehow :)
