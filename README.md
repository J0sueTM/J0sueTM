### Greetings!

I'm a brazilian ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· Software Engineer focused mainly on roles ranging between Low-Level, Desktop, Staff and Backend development.

#### Topics of interest

I find a lot of things interesting and worth of my attention, but specifically Distributed Systems, Programming Langs. Design and Multimedia Processing.

#### My stack

I'm not opinionated on stack. Anything works, and I can work my way around any stack, as long as it's readable ðŸ˜…. Anyways, on my own projects, I work mostly with Clojure/ClojureScript, C and Java.
